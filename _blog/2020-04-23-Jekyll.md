title: Jekyll and Hyde setup
---

Jekyll is a ruby-based static site generator that's perfect for small sites. This post outlines how I set up this site with Jekyll. For a detailed walkthrough, see the instructions on [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/).

First, you'll need to install Ruby, and make sure you have >2.5.0. Use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) if you need to manage multiple Ruby versions:


```
# Install rbenv and ruby-build
brew install rbenv

# Set up rbenv integration with your shell
rbenv init

# Check your installation
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash

# Install and use ruby 2.7.1
rbenv install 2.7.1
rbenv global 2.7.1
```

Now install Jekyll and Bundler

```
gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
```

Get your ruby version

```
ruby -v
ruby 2.7.1p83 (2020-03-31 revision a0c7c23c9c)
```

and add it to your path by adding the following to your shell configuration file, `.bash_profile` or otherwise:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/X.X.0/bin:$PATH"
```

Finally, install Jekyll and Bundler:

```
gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
```


## Theme Setup

Now you can fork the theme you want to use – for this site, I'm using [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) – and clone it so you can add your content:

```
git clone https://github.com/[username]/hyde.git
```

In the project directory, create a Gemfile:

```
bundle init
```

For Hyde add `jekyll-pageinate` and `jekyll-gist` to your Gemfile and run `bundle install` and `bundle update` to install everything.

Finally, to get Hyde to work, change the following options in `_config.yml`:

```yml
# Dependencies
markdown:         kramdown
highlighter:      rouge

plugins:
  - jekyll-paginate
  - jekyll-gist

baseurl: '/'
```

You should now be able to build and run with Jekyll:

```
jekyll build
jekyll serve
```
